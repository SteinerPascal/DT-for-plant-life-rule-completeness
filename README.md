# Testing Rule soundness with SPARQL for simble Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules

This repository demonstrates the possibility to implement the proposed algorith in the paper Conflict Detection in Rule Based IoT Systems (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936266) with SPARQL.

This requires rules which are described in RDF and loaded in a triplestore
